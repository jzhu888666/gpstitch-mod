### DJI Drone Support

Use DJI drone videos with SRT telemetry files. Timezone offset and time alignment are automatically detected from video
metadata, supporting different DJI models and firmware versions.

Camera metrics (ISO, shutter, f-number, EV, color temperature) from SRT files are displayed directly on the video
overlay.

### External GPX & Vertical Video

Use any video with external GPX/FIT files. Vertical videos are automatically detected and rendered correctly.

### Batch Rendering

Process multiple videos at once with the same overlay settings.

### Shared GPX Batch Render

Apply a single GPX track to multiple videos recorded during the same activity. Each video automatically gets an odometer
offset calculated from its creation time relative to the GPX track start, so the overlay shows the correct absolute
distance from the beginning of the track.

### Overlay-Only Mode

Render telemetry overlays with a transparent background — without any source video. Use a GPX, FIT, or SRT file as the
primary input, and GPStitch will generate a video with an alpha channel that you can layer on top of your footage in any
video editor (Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve, Premiere Pro, etc.).

**How to use:**

1. Upload a GPX, FIT, or SRT file as the primary file (no video needed)
2. Configure your overlay layout and widgets as usual
3. Select an encoding profile with transparency support:
    - **MOV (PNG)** — Lossless quality, best compatibility with Final Cut Pro and DaVinci Resolve (large files)
    - **VP9** — Good quality with alpha channel, smaller files
    - **VP8** — Alpha channel support, widest browser compatibility
4. Render — the output is a video with a transparent background ready for compositing

## Command-Line Rendering

GPStitch includes `gpstitch-dashboard`, a CLI command that works as a drop-in replacement for `gopro-dashboard.py` with
all GPStitch patches applied (DJI support, timecode preservation, audio copy, etc.).

Use the "Get Command" button in the UI to generate a ready-to-run `gpstitch-dashboard` command, then paste it into your
terminal:

```bash
gpstitch-dashboard video.mp4 output.mp4 --layout xml --layout-xml layout.xml
```

This is useful for scripting, batch processing, or re-running renders without the UI.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- FFmpeg (must be installed and available in PATH)
- [gopro-overlay](https://pypi.org/project/gopro-overlay/) (installed automatically)

## Installation

### pipx (recommended)

```bash
# Install FFmpeg first
# macOS:    brew install ffmpeg
# Ubuntu:   sudo apt install ffmpeg
# Windows:  choco install ffmpeg

# Install GPStitch
pipx install gpstitch

# Run (opens browser automatically)
gpstitch

# Or with custom host/port
gpstitch --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
```

#### Optional: Cairo widgets support

Some layouts (e.g. `example`, `example-2`) use cairo-based widgets (gauges, circuit maps). These require `pycairo`,
which needs the cairo system library:

```bash
# 1. Install system library
# macOS:    brew install cairo pkg-config
# Ubuntu:   sudo apt install libcairo2-dev pkg-config python3-dev

# 2. Install with cairo support (new install)
pipx install 'gpstitch[cairo]'

# Or add to existing installation
pipx inject gpstitch pycairo
```

Without pycairo, GPStitch works normally — cairo layouts will be marked as unavailable in the UI.

### From source

```bash
# Install uv if not already installed
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Romancha/GPStitch.git
cd gpstitch

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run the application
uv run gpstitch
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

### Supported Input Files

| Type     | Formats                | Description                                                       |
|----------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Video    | `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.avi` | Video files (GoPro and DJI Action files may contain embedded GPS) |
| GPS Data | `.gpx`, `.fit`, `.srt` | External GPS tracks — GPX, FIT, or DJI SRT telemetry (optional)   |

## Time Sync

When using a non-GoPro video with an external GPS file (GPX/FIT), the video and GPS track need to be aligned in time.
GPStitch provides three synchronization modes in the **Time Sync** dropdown:

### Auto (Recommended)

Automatically aligns the video to the GPS track using the video's embedded `creation_time` metadata (set by the camera
when recording starts). GPStitch extracts this timestamp via ffprobe and cross-validates it against the GPS track's time
range.

**Timezone auto-correction:** Some cameras (e.g., Insta360 Go 3S, certain action cameras) incorrectly write local time
into the `creation_time` field instead of UTC as required by the MP4 specification. GPStitch detects this by checking
whether the video time window overlaps with the GPS data. If it doesn't, GPStitch runs a cascade of correction
strategies:

1. **System timezone** — applies your machine's local timezone offset (e.g., PDT = UTC-7). Since GPStitch runs locally,
   this is a strong signal that matches the recording timezone in most workflows.
2. **Exhaustive search** — tries all valid whole-hour and fractional timezone offsets (e.g., UTC+5:45) and picks the one
   that produces overlap with the GPS track. If only one candidate matches, it's used automatically.
3. **File modification time** — as a last resort, checks whether the file's `mtime` happens to overlap the GPS range (
   without any timezone shifting).

If none of these strategies produce a valid alignment, GPStitch reports a failure and suggests a manual offset value.
The UI shows a "Switch to Manual" button pre-filled with the best-guess offset so you can apply it with one click.

When a correction is applied, an info banner shows which strategy was used (e.g., "Applied +7h from your system
timezone"). If no `creation_time` is found in the video metadata, GPStitch uses the file's creation date (less reliable,
shown as a warning).

### Use GPX Timestamps

Skips time alignment entirely. The GPS data is used as-is without synchronization with the video. This mode is useful
when:

- The GPX file has been manually trimmed to exactly match the video segment
- You want the overlay to display the full GPS track regardless of video timing

### Manual Offset

Works the same as **Auto** (uses video metadata for alignment), but allows you to apply a manual correction in seconds (
`+` or `-`). Use this when the automatic alignment is close but slightly off — for example, if the camera's clock was
not perfectly synchronized with GPS time.

The UI shows the base timestamp and the adjusted result so you can see exactly how the offset is applied.

> **Note:** For DJI drones with SRT files, time synchronization is handled automatically — the Time Sync options are not
> shown because GPStitch detects the correct alignment from the SRT telemetry data.

## Configuration

Environment variables (prefix: `GPSTITCH_`):

| Variable               | Default                 | Description                              |
|------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `HOST`                 | `0.0.0.0`               | Server host                              |
| `PORT`                 | `8000`                  | Server port                              |
| `LOCAL_MODE`           | `true`                  | Use local file paths instead of uploads  |
| `TEMPLATES_DIR`        | `~/.gpstitch/templates` | Custom templates directory               |
| `ENABLE_GOPRO_PATCHES` | `true`                  | Enable runtime patches for gopro-overlay |
| `USE_WRAPPER_SCRIPT`   | `true`                  | Use wrapper script for rendering         |

You can also use a `.env` file in the project root.

## Runtime Patches

GPStitch includes runtime patches for `gopro-overlay` that add:

- **Timecode preservation** — Maintains original video timecode for Final Cut Pro compatibility
- **Audio stream copy** — Preserves audio without re-encoding
- **Metadata preservation** — Keeps original video metadata in output
- **DJI camera metrics** — Extends overlay engine with ISO, shutter, f-number, EV, color temperature, and focal length
  from DJI SRT files
- **DJI Osmo Action GPS** — Loads embedded protobuf GPS telemetry from DJI Action cameras with GPS Bluetooth Remote
  Controller
- **Odometer offset** — Allows odometer to start from a custom offset value for shared GPX batch rendering

Patches are applied automatically at startup. To disable:

```bash
export GPSTITCH_ENABLE_GOPRO_PATCHES=false
export GPSTITCH_USE_WRAPPER_SCRIPT=false
```

## Development
